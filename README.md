# Our application

We developed a web application of messaging sharing. It is a simple application that allows users to send messages to each other. Each user can send messages to other users and see the messages that have been sent to him.

# How to use it

To use our application, you need to have a web browser and an internet connection.

* First, download all the files from the repository (`git clone` or fork the repository).
* Then, execute the command `docker-compose up -d`.
* Finally, open your web browser and go to the address `http://localhost:5000/main`.

You need to log in to use the application. If you don't have an account, you can create one by clicking on the 'Register' button.

When you are logged in, you can see the list of users and send messages to them. You can also see the messages that have been sent to you.
